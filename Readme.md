# CloudFirestore - Storage Integration Library
#### ER Lab - UCLA

This package is designed so as to assist web developers to, if necessary, integrate and sync the data stored in their cloud firestore with a custom storage folder.

Please check the iPython notebook for a quick demo and review to functionalities.

To run the code, you just need to pass a configuration file with the -c argument.
